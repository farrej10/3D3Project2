3D3 Project 2: Communication in the Internet of Things
Simple Distance Vector Routing Protocol in C/C++

The purpose of this project is to implement, validate and demonstrate a simple Distance Vector protocol of the type that  might  be  used  by  Peer  to  Peer,  Adhoc,  Wireless  Sensor  or  Internet  of  Things  communication  devices. You should use UDP Sockets and the C/C++ programming language to build a distance vector routing protocol that implements the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Setup

    $ make
    $ ./start-router
    
Runtime

    $ ./inject "Hello, world"
    
    Close terminal windows to kill them and see the table being routed, rerouting is output to file
